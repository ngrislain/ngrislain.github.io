Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which $\int_0^\infty x^2$ launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated
