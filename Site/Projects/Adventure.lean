My kids are between five and eleven, so I usually keep their screen time short—unless they are building the experience themselves. What started as a throwaway line quickly became a pact, and they held me to it. We pulled out sketchbooks, drew some ideas, and soon we were designing a small 3D game together.

We eventually coded it in [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), a very nice and simple Python framework.
The goal was to build a playground where we could tinker with programming and 3D geometry side by side. Pyxel turned out to be perfect for spinning up a mini arcade project, so we leaned all the way in.

Et Voilà! It is called [*Grisly Adventure*](static/projects/adventure/adventure.html).

You can play it, just click on the [link](static/projects/adventure/adventure.html).
Use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot.

Here are a few moments from the game:

And of course, the monsters are coming! 😱
