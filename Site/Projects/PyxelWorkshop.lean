I wanted a small playground to explore programming and 3d geometry with my kids, so we spun up
a mini arcade project in [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).

It is called [Grisly Adventure](static/projects/adventure/adventure.html).
You can play it, just click on the link above, use the arrow keys to move
and the space bar to shoot.

Here is a screenshot of the game:
